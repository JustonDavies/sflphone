SFLPhone-KDE rely on kde.org internationalization infrastructure to gather
translations and receive l10n issues feedback. Please refer to:

* https://techbase.kde.org/Localization
* http://tsdgeos.blogspot.ca/2010/08/how-to-run-messagessh-file-to-create.html

for more detailed description. This file is intended for translators who wish
to bypass kde.org translation process and submit updates directly.

For both legacy and simplicity reasons, some of the translations scripts are
still hoster on SVN as of 2014. The first step is to fetch them:

```
svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/stable/l10n-kde4/scripts
```

The second is to download the current sflphone-kde source code:

```
git clone http://anongit.kde.org/sflphone-kde
cd sflphone-kde
```

Please make sure `xgettext` and `extractrc` (`kde-developer-sdk` package or
 `git clone http://anongit.kde.org/kde-dev-scripts`) are installed

Finally, the `.pot` files need to be extracted.

```
mkdir po
# Depend sur xgettext et extractrc
////l10n-script/extract-messages.sh
```

Two files should now be present in the `./po` directory. They can be opened
manually using a text editor or using the specialized `lokalize` application.

Translations can be sent to `sflphone@lists.savoirfairelinux.net` and/or
`kde-i18n-doc@@kde.org `
